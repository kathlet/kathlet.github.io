This project was completed in Fall 2023.

* Developed physics-based numerical models in Python to predict system behavior using measured data from onboard sensors.
* Engineered custom Python GUIs for real-time plotting of live data streams and for post-processing of large datasets, creating valuable tools for system monitoring and analysis.
