Overview
======
I used FlightStream to build a surface-panel aerodynamic model of a scaled F-16 and to compute static and dynamic aerodynamic derivatives. The project included CAD preparation, meshing, running parameter sweeps, extracting coefficients, and validating results against published datasets (NASA, MachUp).

Role
======
Graduate student researcher â€” responsible for CAD preparation, simulation setup, automation of sweep runs, data processing, and result validation.

Key responsibilities
======
- Imported and prepared SolidWorks CAD geometry for panel discretization.
- Generated surface panel mesh tuned for FlightStream (resolution and smoothing choices documented in notes).
- Defined flight control surfaces (flaperons, stabilators) and parametrized deflection cases.
- Executed systematic parameter sweeps to produce datasets for static and dynamic derivative estimation.
- Calculated aerodynamic coefficients and derivatives by post-processing case outputs.
- Automated post-processing with Python scripts to extract coefficients and produce summary plots and tables.

Results
======
- Produced a complete set of static and dynamic derivatives for the baseline configuration.
- Initial results showed good correlation with NASA and MachUp reference data, validating the modeling approach and setup.
- Generated reproducible scripts and documentation to re-run sweeps and regenerate results.

Tools & technologies
======
- FlightStream (scripting and sweep automation)
- SolidWorks (CAD prep)
- Python (post-processing, plotting)
- Git (version control)

Artifacts

Notes & next steps
======
- Improve mesh convergence testing and run sensitivity studies on panel density.
- Integrate uncertainty quantification for derivative estimates.
- Publish cleaned datasets and plotting scripts in a public repo when permitted.

If you'd like this as a downloadable report or want the post-processing scripts added to the portfolio entry, I can add links or include the code in the repository.
